# EchoGroq
This project is a mini version of ChatGPT designed to provide fast and reliable search results for any query. 

It integrates voice-to-text and text-to-voice technologies, allowing users to interact naturally through speech as well as text. 

The system listens to user queries, converts them into text, fetches the most relevant search results, and then responds back either in text or spoken form.

The goal of this project is to create a lightweight, user-friendly voice-enabled AI assistant that makes information access faster and more interactive, combining the power of conversational AI with seamless search capabilities.
